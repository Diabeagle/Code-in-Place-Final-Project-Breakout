# **BREAKOUT**

## **INSTALLATION:** 
* Use the package manager pip to install Tkinter

## **But, why?:** 
* My final project for Code in Place. I'm so grateful for this wonderful opportunity! 
* For super-fun times.
* Proof that an old dog **CAN** learn new tricks.

### **How do I play?**
* Spacebar launches the ball (only took me 4 hours to make that work!).
* Left and right arrow keys move the player paddle.
* You get three "lives."
* Currently, you must stop and rerun the program if you want to play again.

### **What does the future of Breakout hold?!?**
* Paid DLC! (I'M KIDDING!)
* More opportunities to learn.
* I will be working to add quite a few features that were unable to come to fruition due to deadlines, adulting, and limited programming knowledge, but it's not over!
